# Management_of_AI_study_case_HEC_Lausanne
This repository is made to provide the access to the notebooks we used in the context of the study case of the following article: "Timnit Gebru: "silenced no more" on ai bias and the harms of large language models" made in the context of the Management of AI course at HEC Lausanne.
This notebook is an analysis of the bias and toxicity of different LLMs based on Sasha Luccioni and Meg Mitchell's notebook (https://huggingface.co/blog/evaluating-llm-bias).
